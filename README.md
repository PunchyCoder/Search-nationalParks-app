# Search-nationalParks-app
Allows the user to search for nearby National Parks using the National Park Service API.

This assignment took much longer than I would have liked. I got tripped up by many things:
--Scope errors.
--Requests made to wrong endpoint.
--Strategic errors.
--misspelling classes and such.

I learned well though.
